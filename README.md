# Statistical hypothesis tests for exploring relational data

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks and two standalone Python command line tools to examine the structure of a binary relation that is formatted as a boolean `numpy` array.

## Installation

Install Python 3.x along with `numpy`.

The command line tools `bernoulli_test.py` and `redundancy_sort.py` are self-contained and require no further installation.

## Operation

### Command line tool: `bernoulli_test`

The command line tool is intended to help identify a set of rows from a binary matrix that are likely misclassified.  The command line tool takes as input a threshold (decimal between 0 and 1) and two files that describe two binary relations.  Briefly, given a calling sequence like

```
 $ bernoulli_test <threshold> <file1.txt> <file2.txt>
```

the program will output the 0-based indices of rows in file1 that that probably should have been in file2.  Both files need to have the same number of entries in each row.

The input files are space-delimited streams of "0" or "1" entries, split into equal-length rows.  Each row corresponds to an observation, each entry corresponds to a Boolean response variable.

### Command line tool: `redundancy_sort`

This command line tool Sorts columns in a binary matrix from least to most redundant, grouped based upon column labels.  It is used by

```
 $ redundancy_sort  <matrix_file.txt> <column_headers.txt>
```

The program will dump a sorted list of column headers from <column_headers.txt> to stdout.
